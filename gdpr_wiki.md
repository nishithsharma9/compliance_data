The '''General Data Protection Regulation''' ([https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02016R0679-20160504 '''Regulation (EU) 2016/679'''], abbreviated '''GDPR''') is a [[regulation (European Union)|European Union regulation]] on [[information privacy]] in the [[European Union]] (EU) and the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA). The GDPR is an important component of EU [[privacy law]] and [[human rights law]], in particular Article 8(1) of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]. It also governs the transfer of [[personal data]] outside the EU and EEA. The GDPR's goals are to enhance individuals' control and rights over their personal information and to simplify the regulations for [[international business]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9565-2015-INIT/en/pdf|title=Presidency of the Council: 'Compromise text.

The [[European Parliament]] and [[Council of the European Union]] adopted the GDPR on 14 April 2016, to become effective on 25 May 2018. As an EU regulation (instead of a [[Directive (European Union)|directive]]), GDPR is directly applicable with force of law on its own without the need of [[Transposition (law)|transposition]]. However, it also provides flexibility for individual member states to modify (derogate from) some of its provisions.

The regulation became a model for many other laws around the world, including in Turkey, Mauritius, Chile, Japan, Brazil, South Korea, South Africa, Argentina and Kenya. After [[Brexit|leaving the European Union]] the United Kingdom enacted its "UK GDPR", identical to the GDPR.<ref name=UKGD_1>{{cite web| title=The UK GDPR| url=https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-and-the-eu/data-protection-and-the-eu-in-detail/the-uk-gdpr| website=[[Information Commissioner's Office]] ico.| date=28 June 2021| access-date=3 May 2024}}</ref> The [[California Consumer Privacy Act]] (CCPA), adopted on 28 June 2018, has many similarities with the GDPR.<ref>Francesca Lucarini, [https://advisera.com/eugdpracademy/blog/2020/04/13/gdpr-vs-ccpa-what-are-the-main-differences/ "The differences between the California Consumer Privacy Act and the GDPR"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200712060310/https://advisera.com/eugdpracademy/blog/2020/04/13/gdpr-vs-ccpa-what-are-the-main-differences/ |date=12 July 2020 }}, ''Adviser''</ref>

==Contents==

The GDPR 2016 has eleven chapters, concerning general provisions, principles, rights of the data subject, duties of data controllers or processors, transfers of personal data to third countries, supervisory authorities, cooperation among member states, remedies, liability or penalties for breach of rights, and miscellaneous final provisions. Recital 4 proclaims that ‘processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind’.

===General provisions===
The regulation applies if the data controller (an organisation that collects information about living people, whether they are in the EU or not), or processor (an organisation that processes data on behalf of a data controller like cloud service providers), or the data subject (person) is based in the EU. Under certain circumstances,<ref>'''Article 3(2)''': This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union, where the processing activities are related to:
(a) the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to such data subjects in the Union; or
(b) the monitoring of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the Union.</ref> the regulation also applies to organisations based outside the EU if they collect or process personal data of individuals located inside the EU. The regulation does not apply to the processing of data by a person for a "purely personal or household activity and thus with no connection to a professional or commercial activity." (Recital 18).

According to the [[European Commission]], "Personal data is information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual. If you cannot directly identify an individual from that information, then you need to consider whether the individual is still identifiable. You should take into account the information you are processing together with all the means reasonably likely to be used by either you or any other person to identify that individual."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/key-definitions/what-is-personal-data/|title=What is personal data?|date=January 2021|access-date=22 July 2019|archive-date=24 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724112940/https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/key-definitions/what-is-personal-data/|url-status=live}}</ref> The precise definitions of terms such as "personal data", "processing", "data subject", "controller", and "processor" are stated in '''Article 4''' of the Regulation.<ref name="eur-lex.europa.eu">{{cite web|access-date=21 March 2018|title=EUR-Lex – 32016R0679 – EN – EUR-Lex|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj/eng|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317035823/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj/eng|archive-date=17 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

The regulation does not purport to apply to the processing of personal data for national security activities or law enforcement of the EU; however, industry groups concerned about facing a potential conflict of laws have questioned whether '''Article 48'''<ref name="eur-lex.europa.eu"/> of the GDPR could be invoked to seek to prevent a data controller subject to a third country's laws from complying with a legal order from that country's law enforcement, judicial, or national security authorities to disclose to such authorities the personal data of an EU person, regardless of whether the data resides in or out of the EU. '''Article 48''' states that any judgement of a court or [[tribunal]] and any decision of an administrative authority of a third country requiring a controller or processor to transfer or disclose personal data may not be recognised or enforceable in any manner unless based on an international agreement, like a [[mutual legal assistance treaty]] in force between the requesting third (non-EU) country and the EU or a member state.<ref name="Article 30"/> The data protection reform package also includes a separate Data Protection Directive for the police and criminal justice sector that provides rules on personal data exchanges at [[Member state of the European Union|State level]], Union level, and international levels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/680/oj/eng|title=Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA|date=4 May 2016}}</ref>

A single set of rules applies to all EU member states. Each member state establishes an independent supervisory authority (SA) to hear and investigate complaints, sanction administrative offences, etc. SAs in each member state co-operate with other SAs, providing mutual assistance and organising joint operations. If a business has multiple establishments in the EU, it must have a single SA as its "lead authority", based on the location of its "main establishment" where the main processing activities take place. The lead authority thus acts as a "[[one-stop shop]]" to supervise all the processing activities of that business throughout the EU ('''Articles 46–55''' of the GDPR).<ref>The Proposed EU General Data Protection Regulation. A guide for in-house lawyers, Hunton & Williams LLP, June 2015, p. 14</ref><ref name=":1" /> A [[European Data Protection Board]] (EDPB) co-ordinates the SAs. EDPB thus replaces the '''Article 29''' Data Protection Working Party. There are exceptions for data processed in an employment context or in national security that still might be subject to individual country regulations ('''Articles 2(2)(a)''' and '''88''' of the GDPR).

===Principles and lawful purposes===
'''Article 5''' sets out six ''principles'' relating to the lawfulness of processing personal data. The first of these specifies that data must be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner. Article 6 develops this principle by specifying that personal data may not be processed unless there is at least one legal basis for doing so. The other principles refer to  "purpose limitation", "[[data minimisation]]", "accuracy", "storage limitation", and "integrity and confidentiality".<ref name="32016R0679" />{{rp|Article 5}}

'''Article 6''' states that the lawful purposes are:<ref name="32016R0679">{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32016R0679|title=EUR-Lex – 32016R0679 – EN – EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|access-date=7 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106021830/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679|archive-date=6 November 2017|url-status=live}}.</ref>{{rp|Article 6}}
* (a) If the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data;
* (b) To fulfill contractual obligations with a data subject, or for tasks at the request of a data subject who is in the process of entering into a contract;
* (c) To comply with a data controller's legal obligations;
* (d) To protect the vital interests of a data subject or another individual;
* (e) To perform a task in the public interest or in official authority;
* (f) For the legitimate interests of a data controller or a third party, unless these interests are overridden by interests of the data subject or her or his rights according to the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]] (especially in the case of children).<ref name="Article 30"/>

If informed consent is used as the lawful basis for processing, consent must have been explicit for data collected and each purpose data is used for ('''Article 7'''; defined in '''Article 4''').<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://westminstercollege.edu/student-life/the-forum#comments-f0774046-beef-6cf4-9016-ff000033899e_en |title=newsmyynews |access-date=21 October 2020 |archive-date=22 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201022052405/https://westminstercollege.edu/student-life/the-forum#comments-f0774046-beef-6cf4-9016-ff000033899e_en |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://westminstercollege.edu/student-life/the-forum |title=General_Data_Protection_Regulation |access-date=21 October 2020 |archive-date=22 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201022052405/https://westminstercollege.edu/student-life/the-forum |url-status=live }}</ref> Consent must be a specific, freely given, plainly worded, and unambiguous affirmation given by the data subject; an online form which has consent options structured as an opt-out selected by default is a violation of the GDPR, as the consent is not unambiguously affirmed by the user. In addition, multiple types of processing may not be "bundled" together into a single affirmation prompt, as this is not specific to each use of data, and the individual permissions are not freely given. (Recital 32).

Data subjects must be allowed to withdraw this consent at any time, and the process of doing so must not be harder than it was to opt in. ('''Article 7(3)''') A data controller may not refuse service to users who decline consent to processing that is not strictly necessary in order to use the service. ('''Article 8''') Consent for children, defined in the regulation as being less than 16 years old (although with the option for member states to individually make it as low as 13 years old ('''Article 8(1)'''), must be given by the child's parent or custodian, and verifiable ('''Article 8''').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iapp.org/resources/article/age-of-consent-in-the-gdpr-updated-mapping/|title=Age of consent in the GDPR: updated mapping|website=iapp.org|access-date=26 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180527023437/https://iapp.org/resources/article/age-of-consent-in-the-gdpr-updated-mapping/|archive-date=27 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="privacy association">[https://www.privacyassociation.org/media/presentations/A12_EU_DP_Regulation_PPT.pdf "How the Proposed EU Data Protection Regulation Is Creating a Ripple Effect Worldwide"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210217012511/https://iapp.org/media/presentations/A12_EU_DP_Regulation_PPT.pdf |date=17 February 2021 }}.

If consent to processing was already provided under the Data Protection Directive, a data controller does not have to re-obtain consent if the processing is documented and obtained in compliance with the GDPR's requirements (Recital 171).<ref name="guardian-unneeded"/><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kamleitner|first1=Bernadette|last2=Mitchell|first2=Vince|date=2019-10-01|title=Your Data Is My Data: A Framework for Addressing Interdependent Privacy Infringements|journal=Journal of Public Policy & Marketing|language=en|volume=38|issue=4|pages=433–450|doi=10.1177/0743915619858924|s2cid=201343307|issn=0743-9156|doi-access=free}}</ref>

===Rights of the data subject===
====Transparency and modalities====
'''Article 12''' requires the data controller to provide information to the "data subject in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in particular for any information addressed specifically to a child."<ref name="Article 30"/>

====Information and access====
The [[right of access to personal data|right of access]] ('''Article 15''') is a data subject right.<ref name="eujournalpublication" /> It gives people the right to access their personal data and information about how this personal data is being processed. A data controller must provide, upon request, an overview of the categories of data that are being processed (Article 15(1)(b)) as well as a copy of the actual data ('''Article 15(3)'''); furthermore, the data controller has to inform the data subject on details about the processing, such as the purposes of the processing ('''Article 15(1)(a)'''), with whom the data is shared ('''Article 15(1)(c)'''), and how it acquired the data ('''Article 15(1)(g)''').

A data subject must be able to transfer personal data from one electronic processing system to and into another, without being prevented from doing so by the data controller. Data that has been sufficiently anonymised is excluded, but data that has been only de-identified but remains possible to link to the individual in question, such as by providing the relevant identifier, is not.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/items/611233|title=Guidelines on the right to data portability under Regulation 2016/679|publisher=European Commission|year=2017|access-date=2 November 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629062729/http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=44099|archive-date=29 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In practice, however, providing such identifiers can be challenging, such as in the case of Apple's [[Siri]], where voice and transcript data is stored with a personal identifier that the manufacturer restricts access to,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Veale|first1=Michael|last2=Binns|first2=Reuben|last3=Ausloos|first3=Jef|title=When data protection by design and data subject rights clash|journal=International Data Privacy Law|volume=8|issue=2|pages=105–123|doi=10.1093/idpl/ipy002|year=2018|doi-access=free}}</ref> or in online behavioural targeting, which relies heavily on [[device fingerprint]]s that can be challenging to capture, send, and verify.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zuiderveen Borgesius|first=Frederik J.|date=April 2016|title=Singling out people without knowing their names – Behavioural targeting, pseudonymous data, and the new Data Protection Regulation|journal=Computer Law & Security Review|volume=32|issue=2|pages=256–271|doi=10.1016/j.clsr.2015.12.013|issn=0267-3649}}</ref>

Both data being 'provided' by the data subject and data being 'observed', such as about behaviour, are included. In addition, the data must be provided by the controller in a structured and commonly used standard electronic format. The right to [[data portability]] is provided by '''Article 20''' of the GDPR.<ref name=":0">[http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf Proposal for the EU General Data Protection Regulation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203024154/http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf |date=3 December 2012 }}.

====Rectification and erasure====
A ''[[right to be forgotten]]'' was replaced by a more limited ''right of erasure'' in the version of the GDPR that was adopted by the European Parliament in March 2014.<ref name="1 Essex Court">{{cite web|last1=Baldry|first1=Tony|author-link=Tony Baldry|last2=Hyams|first2=Oliver|title=The Right to Be Forgotten|date=15 May 2014|url=http://1essexcourt.wordpress.com/2014/05/15/the-right-to-be-forgotten/|publisher=1 Essex Court|access-date=1 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019005028/https://1essexcourt.wordpress.com/2014/05/15/the-right-to-be-forgotten/|archive-date=19 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=European Parliament legislative resolution of 12 March 2014 on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation)|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&reference=P7-TA-2014-0212&language=EN|publisher=[[European Parliament]]|access-date=1 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605050912/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&reference=P7-TA-2014-0212&language=EN|archive-date=5 June 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> '''Article 17''' provides that the data subject has the right to request erasure of personal data related to them on any one of a number of grounds, including noncompliance with '''Article 6(1)''' (lawfulness) that includes a case (f) if the legitimate interests of the controller are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, which require protection of personal data (see also ''[[Google Spain v AEPD and Mario Costeja González|Google Spain SL, Google Inc. v Agencia Española de Protección de Datos, Mario Costeja González]]'').<ref name="Article 30"/><ref>{{Cite web |title=Practical Data Privacy {{!}} Books by Thoughtworkers |url=https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/books/practical-data-privacy |access-date=2023-08-25 |website=Thoughtworks |language=en}}</ref>

====Right to object and automated decisions====
'''Article 21''' of the GDPR allows an individual to object to processing personal information for marketing or non-service related purposes.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-object/|title=Right to object|date=30 August 2019|website=ico.org.uk|access-date=14 November 2019|archive-date=2 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202163129/https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-object/|url-status=live}}</ref> This means the data controller must allow an individual the right to stop or prevent controller from processing their personal data.

There are some instances where this objection does not apply. For example, if:

# Legal or official authority is being carried out
# "Legitimate interest", where the organisation needs to process data in order to provide the data subject with a service they signed up for
# A task being carried out for public interest.

GDPR is also clear that the data controller must inform individuals of their right to object from the first communication the controller has with them. This should be clear and separate from any other information the controller is providing and give them their options for how best to object to the processing of their data.

There are instances the controller can refuse a request, in the circumstances that the objection request is "manifestly unfounded" or "excessive", so each case of objection must be looked at individually.<ref name=":4" /> Other countries such as Canada <ref>{{Cite web|title=Using privacy laws to regulate automated decision making|url=https://www.barrysookman.com/2021/04/30/using-privacy-laws-to-regulate-automated-decision-making/|first=Barry|last=Sookman|author2=Charles Morgan|author3=Adam Goldenberg|date=30 April 2021|access-date=2021-05-24|website=Barry Sookman|language=en-US|archive-date=24 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210524193137/https://www.barrysookman.com/2021/04/30/using-privacy-laws-to-regulate-automated-decision-making/|url-status=live}}</ref> are also, following the GDPR, considering legislation to regulate automated decision making under privacy laws, even though there are policy questions as to whether this is the best way to regulate AI.{{Citation needed|date=November 2021|reason=AI regulation is a difficult interdisciplinary topic, we need reliable and replicable sources for this proposition.}}

====Right to compensation====
'''Article 82''' of the GDPR stipulates that any person who has suffered material or non-material damage as a result of an infringement of this Regulation shall have the right to receive compensation from the controller or processor for the damage suffered.

In the judgment ''Österreichische Post'' (C-300/21) the Court of Justice of the European Union gave an interpretation of the right to compensation.<ref>{{CELEX|62021CJ0300|text=Judgment of the Court (Third Chamber) of 4 May 2023.

Compensation is determined nationally in accordance with national law.

===Controller and processor===
Data controllers must clearly disclose any [[data collection]], declare the lawful basis and purpose for data processing, and state how long data is being retained and if it is being shared with any third parties or outside of the EEA. Firms have the obligation to protect data of employees and consumers to the degree where only the necessary data is extracted with minimum interference with data privacy from employees, consumers, or third parties. Firms should have internal controls and regulations for various departments such as audit, internal controls, and operations. Data subjects have the right to request a [[Data portability|portable]] copy of the data collected by a controller in a common format, as well as the right to have their [[Data erasure|data erased]] under certain circumstances. Public authorities, and businesses whose core activities consist of regular or systematic processing of personal data, are required to employ a ''data protection officer'' (DPO), who is responsible for managing compliance with the GDPR. Data controllers must report [[data breach]]es to national supervisory authorities within 72 hours if they have an adverse effect on user privacy. In some cases, violators of the GDPR may be fined up to €20 million or up to 4% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise, whichever is greater.

To be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, the data controller must implement measures that meet the principles of data protection by design and by default. '''Article 25''' requires data protection measures to be designed into the development of business processes for products and services. Such measures include [[pseudonymization|pseudonymising]] personal data, by the controller, as soon as possible (Recital 78). It is the responsibility and the liability of the data controller to implement effective measures and be able to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities even if the processing is carried out by a data processor on behalf of the controller (Recital 74).<ref name="Article 30"/>
When data is collected, data subjects must be clearly [[privacy policy|informed]] about the extent of data collection, the legal basis for the processing of personal data, how long data is retained, if data is being transferred to a third-party and/or outside the EU, and any [[automated decision-making]] that is made on a solely [[algorithm]]ic basis. Data subjects must be informed of their privacy rights under the GDPR,  including their right to revoke consent to data processing at any time, their right to [[#Right of access|view their personal data and access an overview of how it is being processed]], their right to obtain a [[Data portability|portable copy of the stored data]], their right to [[#Data erasure|erasure of their data under certain circumstances]], their right to contest any automated decision-making that was made on a solely [[algorithm]]ic basis, and their right to file complaints with a [[national data protection authority|Data Protection Authority]].

Data protection impact assessments ('''Article 35''') have to be conducted when specific risks occur to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Risk assessment and mitigation is required and prior approval of the data protection authorities is required for high risks.

'''Article 25''' requires data protection to be designed into the development of business processes for products and services. Privacy settings must therefore be set at a high level by default, and technical and procedural measures shall be taken by the controller to make sure that the processing, throughout the whole processing lifecycle, complies with the regulation. Controllers shall also implement mechanisms to ensure that personal data is not processed unless necessary for each specific purpose.  This is known as data minimisation.

A report<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/privacy-and-data-protection-by-design|title=Privacy and Data Protection by Design – ENISA|publisher=Europa (web portal)|url-status=live|access-date=4 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405171636/https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/privacy-and-data-protection-by-design|archive-date=5 April 2017}}</ref> by the [[European Union Agency for Network and Information Security]] elaborates on what needs to be done to achieve privacy and data protection by default. It specifies that encryption and decryption operations must be carried out locally, not by remote service, because both keys and data must remain in the power of the data owner if any privacy is to be achieved. The report specifies that outsourced data storage on remote clouds is practical and relatively safe if only the data owner, not the cloud service, holds the decryption keys.

====Pseudonymisation====
According to the GDPR, [[Pseudonymization|pseudonymisation]] is a required process for stored data that transforms personal data in such a way that the resulting data cannot be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information (as an alternative to the other option of complete [[data anonymisation]]).<ref>[https://www.dativa.com/data-science-gdpr-pseudonymization-data-pipeline/ Data science under GDPR with pseudonymization in the data pipeline] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418230748/https://www.dativa.com/data-science-gdpr-pseudonymization-data-pipeline/|date=18 April 2018}} Published by Dativa, 17 April 2018</ref> An example is [[Encryption software|encryption]], which renders the original data unintelligible in a process that cannot be reversed without access to the correct [[Encryption|decryption key]]. The GDPR requires for the additional information (such as the decryption key) to be kept separately from the pseudonymised data.

Another example of pseudonymisation is [[tokenization (data security)|tokenisation]], which is a non-mathematical approach to protecting [[data at rest]] that replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive substitutes, referred to as tokens. While the tokens have no extrinsic or exploitable meaning or value, they allow for specific data to be fully or partially visible for processing and analytics while sensitive information is kept hidden. [[Tokenization (data security)|Tokenisation]] does not alter the type or length of data, which means it can be processed by legacy systems such as databases that may be sensitive to data length and type. This also requires much fewer computational resources to process and less storage space in databases than traditionally encrypted data.

Pseudonymisation is a [[Privacy-enhancing technologies|privacy-enhancing technology]] and is recommended to reduce the risks to the concerned data subjects and also to help controllers and processors to meet their data protection obligations (Recital 28).<ref name="looking-to"/>

* employing more than 250 people;
* the processing it carries out is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects;
* the processing is not occasional;
* processing includes special categories of data as referred to in Article 9(1) or personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10.

Such requirements may be modified by each EU country. The records shall be in electronic form and the controller or the processor and, where applicable, the controller's or the processor's representative, shall make the record available to the supervisory authority on request.

====Security of personal data====
Controllers and processors of personal data must put in place ''appropriate technical and organizational measures'' to implement the data protection principles. Business processes that handle personal data must be designed and built with consideration of the principles and provide safeguards to protect data (for example, using [[pseudonymization]] or full [[Data anonymization|anonymization]] where appropriate). Data controllers must design information systems with privacy in mind. For instance, using the highest-possible privacy settings by default, so that the datasets are not publicly available by default and cannot be used to identify a subject. No personal data may be processed unless this processing is done under one of the six lawful bases specified by the regulation ([[consent]], contract, public task, vital interest, legitimate interest or legal requirement). When the processing is based on consent the data subject has the right to revoke it at any time.

'''Article 33''' states the data controller is under a legal obligation to notify the supervisory authority without undue delay unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the individuals. There is a maximum of 72 hours after becoming aware of the data breach to make the report. Individuals have to be notified if a high risk of an adverse impact is determined ('''Article 34'''). In addition, the data processor will have to notify the controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach ('''Article 33''').
However, the notice to data subjects is not required if the data controller has implemented appropriate technical and organisational protection measures that render the personal data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption ('''Article 34''').<ref name="Article 30"/>

====Data protection officer====
{{See also|European Commission Data Protection Officer}}
'''Article 37''' requires appointment of a data protection officer. If processing is carried out by a public authority (except for courts or independent judicial authorities when acting in their judicial capacity), or if processing operations involve regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale, or if processing on a large scale of special categories of data and personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences ('''Articles 9''' and '''Article 10''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679|title=EUR-Lex – Art. 37|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|access-date=23 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170122015414/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679|archive-date=22 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>) a data protection officer (DPO)—a person with expert knowledge of data protection law and practices—must be designated to assist the controller or processor in monitoring their internal compliance with the Regulation.<ref name="Article 30"/>

A designated DPO can be a current member of staff of a controller or processor, or the role can be outsourced to an external person or agency through a service contract. In any case, the processing body must make sure that there is no conflict of interest in other roles or interests that a DPO may hold. The contact details for the DPO must be published by the processing organisation (for example, in a privacy notice) and registered with the supervisory authority.

The DPO is similar to a compliance officer and is also expected to be proficient at managing IT processes, [[data security]] (including dealing with [[Attack (computing)|cyberattacks]]) and other critical [[business continuity]] issues associated with the holding and processing of personal and sensitive data. The skill set required stretches beyond understanding legal compliance with data protection laws and regulations. The DPO must maintain a living data inventory of all data collected and stored on behalf of the organization.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.truevault.com/learn/explaining-gdpr-data-subject-requests|title=Explaining GDPR Data Subject Requests|website=TrueVault|access-date=19 February 2019|archive-date=20 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190220063113/https://www.truevault.com/learn/explaining-gdpr-data-subject-requests|url-status=live}}</ref> More details on the function and the role of data protection officer were given on 13 December 2016 (revised 5 April 2017) in a guideline document.<ref>{{Cite web|url=

Organisations based outside the EU must also appoint an EU-based person as a representative and point of contact for their GDPR obligations ('''Article 27'''). This is a distinct role from a DPO, although there is overlap in responsibilities that suggest that this role can also be held by the designated DPO.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=b3db89a5-ac63-4fcb-9d71-b08c00a609e3|title= reach of the GDPR: What is at stake?|work=Lexology|last=Jankowski|first=Piper-Meredith|date= 21 June 2017|access-date=25 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180526041216/https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=b3db89a5-ac63-4fcb-9d71-b08c00a609e3|archive-date=26 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Applicability outside of the European Union ==
The GDPR also applies to data controllers and processors outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) if they are engaged in the "offering of goods or services" (regardless of whether a payment is required) to data subjects within the EEA, or are monitoring the behaviour of data subjects within the EEA (Article 3(2)). The regulation applies regardless of where the processing takes place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fasken.com/en/knowledge/2019/11/the-extra-territorial-scope-of-the-gdpr/|title=The (Extra) Territorial Scope of the GDPR: The Right to Be Forgotten|website=Fasken.com|date=28 November 2019 |language=en|access-date=21 February 2020|archive-date=21 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200221171716/https://www.fasken.com/en/knowledge/2019/11/the-extra-territorial-scope-of-the-gdpr/|url-status=live}}</ref> This has been interpreted as intentionally giving GDPR [[extraterritorial jurisdiction]] for non-EU establishments if they are doing business with people located in the EU. It is questionable whether the EU or its member states will in practice be able to enforce GDPR against organisations which have no establishment in the EU.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/publications/blt/2018/04/01_speirs/|title=Extraterritorial Scope of GDPR: Do Businesses Outside the EU Need to Comply?|publisher=American Bar Association|language=en|access-date=21 February 2020|archive-date=21 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200221171715/https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/publications/blt/2018/04/01_speirs/|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== EU Representative ===
Under Article 27, non-EU establishments subject to GDPR are obliged to have a designee within the European Union, an "EU Representative", to serve as a point of contact for their obligations under the regulation. The EU Representative is the Controller's or Processor's contact person vis-à-vis European privacy supervisors and data subjects, in all matters relating to processing, to ensure compliance with this GDPR. A natural (individual) or moral (corporation) person can play the role of an EU Representative.<ref>Art. 27(4) GDPR.</ref> The non-EU establishment must issue a duly signed document (letter of accreditation) designating a given individual or company as its EU Representative. The said designation can only be given in writing.<ref>Art. 27(1) GDPR.</ref>

An establishment's failure to designate an EU Representative is considered ignorance of the regulation and relevant obligations, which itself is a violation of the GDPR subject to fines of up to €10&nbsp;million or up to 2% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise, whichever is greater. The intentional or negligent (willful blindness) character of the infringement (failure to designate an EU Representative) may rather constitute aggravating factors.<ref>Art. 83(1), (2) & (4a) GDPR.</ref>

An establishment does not need to name an EU Representative if they only engage in occasional processing that does not include, on a large scale, processing of special categories of data as referred to in Article 9(1) of GDPR or processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10, and such processing is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, taking into account the nature, context, scope and purposes of the processing.<ref name="Article 30"/> Non-EU public authorities and bodies are equally exempted.<ref>Art. 27(2) GDPR.</ref>

=== Third countries ===
Chapter V of the GDPR forbids the transfer of the personal data of EU data subjects to countries outside of the EEA — known as ''third countries'' — unless appropriate safeguards are imposed, or the third country's data protection regulations are formally considered adequate by the European Commission (Article 45).<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.dlapiper.com/privacymatters/uk-gdpr-brexit-flowchart/|title=UK: Understanding the full impact of Brexit on UK: EU data flows|date=23 September 2019|website=Privacy Matters|publisher=[[DLA Piper]]|language=en-US|access-date=20 February 2020|archive-date=20 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200220164635/https://blogs.dlapiper.com/privacymatters/uk-gdpr-brexit-flowchart/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/on-data-protection-the-uk-says-it-will-go-it-alone-it-probably-wont/|title=On data protection, the UK says it will go it alone.

Thereafter, the regulation will be referred to as "UK GDPR".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145180/google-uk-user-data-processing-ireland-usa-authorities-data-protection-gdpr-cloud-act|title=Google shifts authority over UK user data to the US in wake of Brexit|last=Porter|first=Jon|date=20 February 2020|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=20 February 2020|archive-date=20 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200220164636/https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145180/google-uk-user-data-processing-ireland-usa-authorities-data-protection-gdpr-cloud-act|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":6" /><ref name=":5" /> The UK will not restrict the transfer of personal data to countries within the EEA under UK GDPR.

In April 2019, the UK [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO) issued a [[Children's Code|children's code of practice]] for social networking services when used by minors, enforceable under GDPR, which also includes restrictions on "[[Like button|like]]" and "streak" mechanisms in order to discourage [[social media addiction]] and on the use of this data for processing interests.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47933521|title=Under-18s face 'like' and 'streaks' limits|date=15 April 2019|work=BBC News|access-date=15 April 2019|archive-date=15 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190415172531/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47933521|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Greenfield|first=Patrick|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/15/facebook-urged-to-ditch-like-feature-in-uk-online-child-safety-drive|title=Facebook urged to disable 'like' feature for child users|date=15 April 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=15 April 2019|issn=0261-3077|archive-date=15 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190415085023/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/15/facebook-urged-to-ditch-like-feature-in-uk-online-child-safety-drive|url-status=live}}</ref>

In March 2021, [[Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport]] [[Oliver Dowden]] stated that the UK was exploring divergence from the EU GDPR in order to "[focus] more on the outcomes that we want to have and less on the burdens of the rules imposed on individual businesses".<ref>{{Cite web|title=UK seeks divergence from GDPR to 'fuel growth'|url=https://www.itpro.co.uk/policy-legislation/data-protection/358874/uk-seeks-divergence-from-gdpr-to-fuel-growth|first=Keumars|last=Afifi-Sabet|date=12 March 2021|access-date=2021-03-12|website=IT PRO|language=en|archive-date=13 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210313063042/https://www.itpro.co.uk/policy-legislation/data-protection/358874/uk-seeks-divergence-from-gdpr-to-fuel-growth|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Misconceptions==
Some common misconceptions about GDPR include:

*All processing of personal data requires consent of the data subject
**In fact, data can be processed without consent if one of the other five lawful bases for processing applies, and obtaining consent may often be inappropriate.<ref name="ico-myth">{{cite web|url=https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/data-sharing/data-sharing-myths-busted/|title=Data sharing myths busted|access-date=19 October 2023|work=Information Commissioner's Office|date=19 May 2023 }}</ref>
*Individuals have an absolute right to have their data deleted (right to be forgotten)
**Whilst there is an absolute right to opt-out of direct marketing, data controllers can continue to process personal data where they have a lawful basis to do so, as long as the data remain necessary for the purpose for which it was originally collected.<ref name="wslaw-myth">{{cite web|url=https://wslaw.co.uk/insight/top-nine-gdpr-myths-busted/|title=Top nine GDPR myths busted|work=WS Law|date=22 January 2019|access-date=19 October 2023}}</ref>
*Removing individuals' names from records takes them out of scope of GDPR
**"Pseudonymous" data where an individual is identified by a number can still be personal data if the data controller is capable of tying that data back to an individual in another way.<ref name="ff-myth">{{cite web|url=https://www.fieldfisher.com/en/services/privacy-security-and-information/privacy-security-and-information-law-blog/five-gdpr-myth-busters-2023|title=Five GDPR myth-busters|access-date=19 October 2023|work=Field Fisher|date=11 May 2023}}</ref>
*GDPR applies to anyone processing personal data of EU citizens anywhere in the world
**In fact, it applies to non-EU established organizations only where they are processing data of data subjects located in the EU (irrespective of their citizenship) and then only when supplying goods or services to them, or monitoring their behaviour.<ref>Article 3 (2) of the GDPR</ref>

== Reception ==
As per a study conducted by Deloitte in 2018, 92% of companies believe they are able to comply with GDPR in their business practices in the long run.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gooch|first=Peter|date=2018|title=A new era for privacy - GDPR six months on|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/uk/Documents/risk/deloitte-uk-risk-gdpr-six-months-on.pdf|access-date=November 26, 2020|website=Deloitte UK|archive-date=12 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201012110809/https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/uk/Documents/risk/deloitte-uk-risk-gdpr-six-months-on.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

Companies operating outside of the EU have invested heavily to align their business practices with GDPR. The area of GDPR consent has a number of implications for businesses who record calls as a matter of practice. A typical disclaimer is not considered sufficient to gain assumed consent to record calls. Additionally, when recording has commenced, should the caller withdraw their consent, then the agent receiving the call must be able to stop a previously started recording and ensure the recording does not get stored.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xewave.io/how-smart-businesses-can-avoid-gdpr-penalties-when-recording-calls/|title=How Smart Businesses Can Avoid GDPR Penalties When Recording Calls|website=xewave.io|access-date=13 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414011044/https://www.xewave.io/how-smart-businesses-can-avoid-gdpr-penalties-when-recording-calls/|archive-date=14 April 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Academic experts who participated in the formulation of the GDPR wrote that the law "is the most consequential regulatory development in information policy in a generation.

Despite having had at least two years to prepare and do so, many companies and websites changed their privacy policies and features worldwide directly prior to GDPR's implementation, and customarily provided email and other notifications discussing these changes. This was criticised for resulting in a fatiguing number of communications, while experts noted that some reminder emails incorrectly asserted that new consent for data processing had to be obtained for when the GDPR took effect (any previously obtained consent to processing is valid as long as it met the regulation's requirements). [[Phishing]] scams also emerged using falsified versions of GDPR-related emails, and it was also argued that some GDPR notice emails may have actually been sent in violation of anti-spam laws.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.itpro.co.uk/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/31058/scammers-are-using-gdpr-email-alerts-to-conduct|title=Scammers are using GDPR email alerts to conduct phishing attacks|last=Afifi-Sabet|first=Keumars|date=3 May 2018|work=IT PRO|access-date=25 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180526041641/http://www.itpro.co.uk/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/31058/scammers-are-using-gdpr-email-alerts-to-conduct|archive-date=26 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="guardian-unneeded">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/21/gdpr-emails-mostly-unnecessary-and-in-some-cases-illegal-say-experts|title=Most GDPR emails unnecessary and some illegal, say experts|last=Hern|first=Alex|date=21 May 2018|website=The Guardian|access-date=28 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180528054755/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/21/gdpr-emails-mostly-unnecessary-and-in-some-cases-illegal-say-experts|archive-date=28 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In March 2019, a provider of compliance software found that many websites operated by EU member state governments contained embedded tracking from ad technology providers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://social.techcrunch.com/2019/03/18/eu-govt-and-public-health-sites-lousy-with-adtech-study-finds/|title=EU gov't and public health sites are lousy with adtech, study finds|website=TechCrunch|date=18 March 2019 |access-date=18 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/6dbacf74-471b-11e9-b168-96a37d002cd3|title=EU citizens being tracked on sensitive government websites|website=Financial Times|date=18 March 2019|access-date=18 March 2019|archive-date=19 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190319130253/https://www.ft.com/content/6dbacf74-471b-11e9-b168-96a37d002cd3|url-status=live}}</ref>

The deluge of GDPR-related notices also inspired [[internet meme|memes]], including those surrounding privacy policy notices being delivered by atypical means (such as a [[Ouija]] board or [[Star Wars opening crawl|''Star Wars'' opening crawl]]), suggesting that [[Santa Claus]]'s "naughty or nice" list was a violation, and a recording of excerpts from the regulation by a former [[BBC Radio 4]] [[Shipping Forecast]] announcer. A blog, ''GDPR Hall of Shame'', was also created to showcase unusual delivery of GDPR notices, and attempts at compliance that contained egregious violations of the regulation's requirements. Its author remarked that the regulation "has a lot of nitty gritty, in-the-weeds details, but not a lot of information about how to comply", but also acknowledged that businesses had two years to comply, making some of its responses unjustified.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/3/17413390/gdpr-legislation-asleep-in-seconds-listening-meditation-app-peter-jefferson|title=Fall asleep in seconds by listening to a soothing voice read the EU's new GDPR legislation|work=The Verge|access-date=16 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617015346/https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/3/17413390/gdpr-legislation-asleep-in-seconds-listening-meditation-app-peter-jefferson|archive-date=17 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/gdpr-memes/|title=How Europe's GDPR Regulations Became a Meme|magazine=Wired|access-date=17 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618002541/https://www.wired.com/story/gdpr-memes/|archive-date=18 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.adweek.com/digital/the-internet-created-a-gdpr-inspired-meme-using-privacy-policies/|title=The Internet Created a GDPR-Inspired Meme Using Privacy Policies|work=Adweek|access-date=17 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617221720/https://www.adweek.com/digital/the-internet-created-a-gdpr-inspired-meme-using-privacy-policies/|archive-date=17 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/happy-gdpr-day-gdpr-hall-of-shame|title=Help, my lightbulbs are dead!

In July 2019, the British [[Information Commissioner's Office]] issued an intention to fine [[British Airways]] a record £183 million (1.5% of turnover) for poor security arrangements that enabled a 2018 [[web skimming]] attack affecting around 380,000 transactions.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Intention to fine British Airways £183.39m under GDPR for data breach|url=https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2019/07/ico-announces-intention-to-fine-british-airways/|date=8 July 2019|website=ICO|access-date=22 December 2020|archive-date=6 December 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201206171628/https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2019/07/ico-announces-intention-to-fine-british-airways/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Whittaker|first1=Zack|date=11 September 2018|title=British Airways breach caused by credit card skimming malware, researchers say|work=TechCrunch|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/11/british-airways-breach-caused-by-credit-card-skimming-malware-researchers-say/|url-status=live|access-date=9 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181210063331/https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/11/british-airways-breach-caused-by-credit-card-skimming-malware-researchers-say/|archive-date=10 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=7 September 2018|title=British Airways boss apologises for 'malicious' data breach|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-45440850?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c1xp19421ezt/cyber-crime&link_location=live-reporting-story|url-status=live|access-date=7 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015164522/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-45440850?intlink_from_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Ftopics%2Fc1xp19421ezt%2Fcyber-crime&link_location=live-reporting-story|archive-date=15 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=8 July 2019|title=BA faces £183m fine over passenger data breach|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/08/ba-fine-customer-data-breach-british-airways|access-date=8 July 2019|issn=0261-3077|archive-date=8 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190708083104/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/08/ba-fine-customer-data-breach-british-airways|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=8 July 2019|title=British Airways faces record £183m fine for data breach|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48905907|access-date=8 July 2019|archive-date=8 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190708064601/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48905907|url-status=live}}</ref> British Airways was ultimately fined a reduced amount of £20m, with the ICO noting that they had "considered both representations from BA and the economic impact of COVID-19 on their business before setting a final penalty".<ref>{{Cite web|title=ICO fines British Airways £20m for data breach affecting more than 400,000 customers|url=https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2020/10/ico-fines-british-airways-20m-for-data-breach-affecting-more-than-400-000-customers/|date=16 October 2020|website=ICO|access-date=22 December 2020|archive-date=16 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201016173648/https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2020/10/ico-fines-british-airways-20m-for-data-breach-affecting-more-than-400-000-customers/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In December 2019, ''Politico'' reported that Ireland and Luxembourg – two smaller EU countries that have had a reputation as a [[tax haven]]s and (especially in the case of Ireland) as a base for European subsidiaries of U.S. [[big tech]] companies – were facing significant backlogs in their investigations of major foreign companies under GDPR, with Ireland citing the complexity of the regulation as a factor. Critics interviewed by ''Politico'' also argued that enforcement was also being hampered by varying interpretations between member states, the prioritisation of guidance over enforcement by some authorities, and a lack of cooperation between member states.<ref>{{Cite web|title='We have a huge problem': European regulator despairs over lack of enforcement|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/we-have-a-huge-problem-european-regulator-despairs-over-lack-of-enforcement/|last=Vinocur|first=Nicholas|date=27 December 2019|website=Politico|access-date=6 May 2020|archive-date=28 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191228111507/https://www.politico.eu/article/we-have-a-huge-problem-european-regulator-despairs-over-lack-of-enforcement/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In November 2021, Irish Council for Civil Liberties lodged a formal complaint of the Commission that it is in breach of its obligation under EU Law to carefully monitor how Ireland applies the GDPR.<ref name=":10">{{Cite web |last=Ryan |first=Johnny |date=2023-01-31 |title=Europe-wide overhaul of GDPR monitoring triggered by ICCL |url=https://www.iccl.ie/digital-data/europe-wide-overhaul-of-gdpr-monitoring-triggered-by-iccl/ |access-date=2023-04-08 |website=Irish Council for Civil Liberties |language=en-GB |archive-date=6 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230406075809/https://www.iccl.ie/digital-data/europe-wide-overhaul-of-gdpr-monitoring-triggered-by-iccl/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Until January 2023, the Commission published a new commitment based on the complaint of ICCL.<ref name=":10" />

While companies are now subject to legal obligations, there are still various inconsistencies in the practical and technical implementation of GDPR.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Alizadeh|first1=Fatemeh|last2=Jakobi|first2=Timo|last3=Boldt|first3=Jens|last4=Stevens|first4=Gunnar|title=Proceedings of Mensch und Computer 2019 |chapter=GDPR-Reality Check on the Right to Access Data |date=2019|pages=811–814|location=New York|publisher=ACM Press|doi=10.1145/3340764.3344913|isbn=978-1-4503-7198-8|s2cid=202159324}}</ref> As an example, according to the GDPR's right to access, the companies are obliged to provide data subjects with the data they gather about them.

Therefore, data subjects tend to see that as a GDPR violation. As a result, studies have suggested for a better control through authorities.<ref name=":7" />

According to the GDPR, end-users' [[consent]] should be valid, freely given, specific, informed and active.<ref name=":8">{{Cite book|last1=Human|first1=Soheil|last2=Cech|first2=Florian|title=Human Centred Intelligent Systems |chapter=A Human-Centric Perspective on Digital Consenting: The Case of GAFAM |date=2021|editor-last=Zimmermann|editor-first=Alfred|editor2-last=Howlett|editor2-first=Robert J.|editor3-last=Jain|editor3-first=Lakhmi C.|series=Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies|volume=189|language=en|location=Singapore|publisher=Springer|pages=139–159|doi=10.1007/978-981-15-5784-2_12|isbn=978-981-15-5784-2|s2cid=214699040|chapter-url=https://epub.wu.ac.at/7523/1/HCIS2020_A%20Human-centric%20Perspective%20on%20Digital%20Consenting_The%20Case%20of%20GAFAM_Soheil%20Human_Florian%20Cech.pdf|access-date=23 August 2020|archive-date=14 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210414233129/https://epub.wu.ac.at/7523/1/HCIS2020_A%20Human-centric%20Perspective%20on%20Digital%20Consenting_The%20Case%20of%20GAFAM_Soheil%20Human_Florian%20Cech.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> However, the lack of enforceability regarding obtaining lawful consents has been a challenge. As an example, a 2020 study, showed that the [[Big Tech]], i.e. [[Google]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[Facebook]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and [[Microsoft]] (GAFAM), use [[dark pattern]]s in their consent obtaining mechanisms, which raises doubts regarding the lawfulness of the acquired consent.<ref name=":8" />

=== Influence on foreign laws ===
Mass adoption of these new privacy standards by multinational companies has been cited as an example of the "[[Brussels effect]]", a phenomenon wherein European laws and regulations are used as a  baseline due to their gravitas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2018/05/24/the-gdpr-is-in-effect-should-u-s-companies-be-afraid/|title=The GDPR Is in Effect: Should U.S. Companies Be Afraid?|last=Roberts|first=Jeff John|date=25 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180528010135/http://fortune.com/2018/05/24/the-gdpr-is-in-effect-should-u-s-companies-be-afraid/|archive-date=28 May 2018|url-status=live|access-date=28 May 2018}}</ref>

The U.S. state of [[California]] passed the [[California Consumer Privacy Act]] on 28 June 2018, taking effect on 1 January 2020; it grants rights to transparency and control over the collection of personal information by companies in a similar means to GDPR. Critics have argued that such laws need to be implemented at the federal level to be effective, as a collection of state-level laws would have varying standards that would complicate compliance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2018/10/23/california-data-privacy-law-gdpr/|title=Commentary: California's New Data Privacy Law Could Begin a Regulatory Disaster|website=Fortune|access-date=10 April 2019|archive-date=10 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190410052357/http://fortune.com/2018/10/23/california-data-privacy-law-gdpr/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/california-unanimously-passes-historic-privacy-bill|title=California Unanimously Passes Historic Privacy Bill|magazine=Wired|access-date=29 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629224553/https://www.wired.com/story/california-unanimously-passes-historic-privacy-bill/|archive-date=29 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://adage.com/article/digital/california-passed-version-gdpr/314079/|title=Marketers and tech companies confront California's version of GDPR|access-date=29 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629211518/http://adage.com/article/digital/california-passed-version-gdpr/314079/|archive-date=29 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Two other U.S. states have since enacted similar legislation: [[Virginia]] passed the Consumer Data Privacy Act on 2 March 2021,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iapp.org/news/a/virginia-passes-the-consumer-data-protection-act/|title=Virginia passes the Consumer Data Protection Act|website=International Association of Privacy Professionals|date=3 March 2021|access-date=26 August 2021|archive-date=30 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210830135050/https://iapp.org/news/a/virginia-passes-the-consumer-data-protection-act/|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Colorado]] enacted the Colorado Privacy Act on 8 July 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iapp.org/news/a/colorado-privacy-act-becomes-law/|title=Colorado Privacy Act becomes law|website=International Association of Privacy Professionals|date=8 July 2021|access-date=26 August 2021|archive-date=26 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210826131532/https://iapp.org/news/a/colorado-privacy-act-becomes-law/|url-status=live}}</ref>
