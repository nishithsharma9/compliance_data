The abbreviation PII is widely accepted in the [[United States]], but the phrase it abbreviates has four common variants based on ''personal'' or ''personally'', and ''identifiable'' or ''identifying''. Not all are equivalent, and for legal purposes the effective definitions vary depending on the jurisdiction and the purposes for which the term is being used.{{Efn|In other countries with privacy protection laws derived from the [[OECD]] privacy principles, the term used is more often "personal information", which may be somewhat broader: in Australia's ''Privacy Act ''1988 (Cth) "personal information" also includes information from which the person's identity is "reasonably ascertainable", potentially covering some information not covered by PII.}} Under [[European Union]] and [[United Kingdom]] data protection regimes, which centre primarily on the [[General Data Protection Regulation]] (GDPR),<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Skiera |first1=Bernd |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1303894344 |title=The impact of the GDPR on the online advertising market |year=2022 |first2=Klaus |last2=Miller |first3=Yuxi |last3=Jin |first4=Lennart |last4=Kraft |first5=René |last5=Laub |first6=Julia |last6=Schmitt |isbn=978-3-9824173-0-1 |location=Frankfurt am Main |oclc=1303894344}}</ref> the term "personal data" is significantly broader, and determines the scope of the regulatory regime.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=Paul M|last2=Solove|first2=Daniel|date=2014|title=Reconciling Personal Information in the United States and European Union|journal=California Law Review|language=en|volume=102|issue=4|doi=10.15779/Z38Z814|s2cid=141313154 }}</ref>

For instance, a user's [[IP address]] is not classed as PII on its own, but is classified as a linked PII.<ref>Section 3.3.3 "Identifiability"</ref>

Personal data is defined under the GDPR as "any information which [is] related to an identified or identifiable natural person".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Personal Data|url=https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/personal-data/|access-date=2020-10-23|website=General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":1" /> The IP address of an Internet subscriber may be classed as personal data.<ref name="ECJ-IP">{{cite news |date=19 October 2016 |title=European Court of Justice rules IP addresses are personal data |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/european-court-of-justice-rules-ip-addresses-are-personal-data-1.2835704 |access-date=10 March 2019 |newspaper=The Irish Times}}</ref>

The concept of PII has become prevalent as [[information technology]] and the [[Internet]] have made it easier to collect PII leading to a profitable market in collecting and reselling PII. PII can also be exploited by criminals to [[stalking|stalk]] or [[identity theft|steal the identity]] of a person, or to aid in the planning of criminal acts. As a response to these threats, many website [[privacy policy|privacy policies]] specifically address the [[Gathering of personally identifiable information|gathering of PII]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nokhbeh|first=Razieh|date=2017|title=A study of web privacy policies across industries.|journal=Journal of Information Privacy & Security|volume=13|pages=169–185}}</ref> and lawmakers such as the [[European Parliament]] have enacted a series of legislation such as the GDPR to limit the distribution and accessibility of PII.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9565-2015-INIT/en/pdf|title=Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation)|date=11 June 2015|website=European Data Consilium|access-date=3 April 2019}}</ref>

Important confusion arises around whether PII means information which is identifiable (that is, can be associated with a person) or identifying (that is, associated uniquely with a person, such that the PII ''identifies'' them). In prescriptive data privacy regimes such as the US federal [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA), PII items have been specifically defined. In broader data protection regimes such as the GDPR, personal data is defined in a non-prescriptive principles-based way. Information that might not count as PII under HIPAA can be personal data for the purposes of GDPR. For this reason, "PII" is typically deprecated internationally.

== Definitions ==
The [[United States|U.S]]. government used the term "personally identifiable" in 2007 in a memorandum from the Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget (OMB),<ref name="whitehouse.gov">[https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2007/m07-16.pdf M-07-16 SUBJECT:Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally Identifiable Information] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200208192242/https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2007/m07-16.pdf |date=8 February 2020 }} FROM: Clay Johnson III, Deputy Director for Management (2007/05/22)</ref> and that usage now appears in US standards such as the [[NIST]] ''Guide to Protecting the Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information'' (SP 800-122).<ref name="NIST" /> The OMB memorandum defines PII as follows:

{{quote|Information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc. alone, or when combined with other personal or recognizing linked or linkable information, such as date and place of birth, as well as the mother's maiden name, in official standards like the NIST Guide, demonstrates a proactive approach to ensuring robust privacy safeguards amid the dynamic landscape of data security. This integration into established standards is a foundational framework for organizations to adopt and implement effective measures in safeguarding individuals' personal information.|author=NIST|title=NIST Privacy Framework|source=https://www.nist.gov/privacy-framework}}

A term similar to PII, "personal data", is defined in EU directive 95/46/EC, for the purposes of the directive:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:EN:HTML |title=Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |access-date=20 August 2013}}</ref>

{{quote|Article 2a: 'personal data' shall mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity;}}

In the [[European Union|EU]] rules, there has been a more specific notion that the data subject can potentially be identified through additional processing of other attributes—quasi- or pseudo-identifiers. In the GDPR, personal data is defined as:

{{quote|Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person<ref>{{cite web |title=What is personal data? |url=https://www.truevault.com/learn/what-is-personal-data |website=TrueVault}}</ref>}}

A simple example of this distinction: the color name "red" by itself is ''not'' personal data, but that same value stored as part of a person's record as their "favorite color" ''is'' personal data; it is the connection to the person that makes it personal data, not (as in PII) the value itself.

Another term similar to PII, "personal information", is defined in a section of the California data breach notification law, SB1386:<ref name="California">{{cite web
| url= http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/01-02/bill/sen/sb_1351-1400/sb_1386_bill_20020926_chaptered.html
| title=Text of California Senate Bill SB 1386 ref paragraph SEC. 2 1798.29.(e)
| publisher=California
}}</ref>

{{quote|(e) For purposes of this section, "personal information" means an individual's first name or first initial and last name in combination with any one or more of the following data elements, when either the name or the data elements are not encrypted:  (1) Social security number. (2) Driver's license number or California Identification Card number. (3) Account number, credit or debit card number, in combination with any required security code, access code, or password that would permit access to an individual's financial account. (f) For purposes of this section, "personal information" does not include publicly available information that is lawfully made available to the general public from federal, state, or local government records.}}

The concept of information combination given in the SB1386 definition is key to correctly distinguishing PII, as defined by OMB, from "personal information", as defined by SB1386.  Information, such as a name, that lacks context cannot be said to be SB1386 "personal information", but it must be said to be PII as defined by OMB. For example, the name "[[Placeholder name|John Smith]]" has no meaning in the current context and is therefore not SB1386 "personal information", but it is PII. A [[Social Security Number]] (SSN) without a name or some other associated identity or context information is not SB1386 "personal information", but it is PII. For example, the SSN 078-05-1120 by itself is PII, but it is not SB1386 "personal information". However the combination of a valid name with the correct SSN is SB1386 "personal information".<ref name="California" />

The combination of a name with a context may also be considered PII; for example, if a person's name is on a list of patients for an HIV clinic. However, it is not necessary for the name to be combined with a context in order for it to be PII. The reason for this distinction is that bits of information such as names, although they may not be sufficient by themselves to make an identification, may later be combined with other information to identify persons and expose them to harm.

According to the OMB, it is not always the case that PII is "sensitive", and context may be taken into account in deciding whether certain PII is or is not sensitive.<ref name="whitehouse.gov" />{{full citation needed|date=April 2013}}

When a person wishes to remain anonymous, descriptions of them will often employ several of the above, such as "a 34-year-old white male who works at Target". Information can still be ''private'', in the sense that a person may not wish for it to become publicly known, without being personally identifiable. Moreover, sometimes multiple pieces of information, none sufficient by itself to uniquely identify an individual, may uniquely identify a person when combined; this is one reason that multiple pieces of evidence are usually presented at criminal trials. It has been shown that, in 1990, 87% of the population of the United States could be uniquely identified by gender, [[ZIP code]], and full date of birth.<ref>{{cite web

==Laws and standards==
=== Australia ===
In Australia, the [[Privacy Act 1988]] deals with the protection of individual privacy, using the OECD Privacy Principles from the 1980s to set up a broad, principles-based regulatory model (unlike in the US, where coverage is generally not based on broad principles but on specific technologies, business practices or data items). Section 6 has the relevant definition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/pa1988108/s6.html|title=Privacy Act 1988|access-date=15 May 2019}}</ref> The critical detail is that the definition of 'personal information' also applies to where the individual can be indirectly identified:

{{quote|"personal information" means information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable whether the information or opinion is true or not; and whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not. }}

It appears that this definition is significantly broader than the Californian example given above, and thus that Australian privacy law may cover a broader category of data and information than in some US law.

In particular, online [[behavioral advertising]] businesses based in the US but surreptitiously collecting information from people in other countries in the form of cookies, [[Web bug|bugs]], trackers and the like may find that their preference to avoid the implications of wanting to build a [[psychographic profile]] of a particular person using the rubric of 'we don't collect personal information' may find that this does not make sense under a broader definition like that in the Australian Privacy Act.

The term "PII" is not used in Australian privacy law.

=== United States ===
The [[Privacy Act of 1974]] (Pub.L. 93–579, 88 Stat. 1896, enacted 31 December 1974, {{USC|5|552a}}, a United States federal law, establishes a Code of Fair Information Practice that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of personally identifiable information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2014-06-16|title=Privacy Act of 1974|url=https://www.justice.gov/opcl/privacy-act-1974|access-date=2020-12-06|website=www.justice.gov|language=en}}</ref>

One of the primary focuses of the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA) is to protect a patient's [[Protected Health Information]] (PHI), which is similar to PII. The U.S. Senate proposed the Privacy Act of 2005, which attempted to strictly limit the display, purchase, or sale of PII without the person's consent. Similarly, the (proposed) Anti-Phishing Act of 2005 attempted to prevent the acquiring of PII through [[phishing]].

U.S. lawmakers have paid special attention to the [[social security number]] because it can be easily used to commit [[identity theft]]. The (proposed) Social Security Number Protection Act of 2005 and (proposed) Identity Theft Prevention Act of 2005 each sought to limit the distribution of an individual's social security number.

== Personal safety ==
Personal data is a key component of [[online identity]] and can be exploited by individuals. For instance, data can be altered and used to create fake documents, hijack mail boxes and phone calls or harass people, as occurred in 2019 to a customer of the [[EE Limited|EE]] mobile phone operator in the UK.<ref>{{cite web

Also, several agencies ask for discretion on subjects related to their work, for the safety of their employees. For this reason, the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) has strict policies controlling release of personally identifiable information of DoD personnel.<ref>{{cite web

==Trade of personal data==
{{see also|Surveillance capitalism}}

During the second half of the 20th century, the [[digital revolution]] introduced "privacy economics", or the trade of personal data. The value of data can change over time and over different contexts. Disclosing data can reverse [[information asymmetry]], though the costs of doing so can be unclear. In relation to companies, consumers often have "imperfect information regarding when their data is collected, with what purposes, and with what consequences".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.law.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-Economics-of-Privacy.pdf |title=The Economics of Privacy |first1=Alessandro |last1=Acquisti |first2=Curtis |last2=Taylor |first3=Liad |last3=Wagman |year=2015 }}</ref>

Writing in 2015, Alessandro Acquisti, Curtis Taylor and Liad Wagman identified three "waves" in the trade of personal data:
#In the 1970s, the [[Chicago Boys]] school claimed that protection of privacy could have a negative impact on the market because it could lead to incorrect and non-optimal decisions. Other researchers like Andrew F. Daughety and [[Jennifer F. Reinganum]] suggested that the opposite was true, and that absence of privacy would also lead to this.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Public goods, social pressure, and the choice between privacy and publicity |journal=American Economic Journal: Microeconomics |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=191–221 |first1=A. |last1=Daughety |first2=J. |last2=Reinganum |year=2010 |doi=10.1257/mic.2.2.191 |citeseerx=10.1.1.544.9031 }}</ref>
#In the mid-1990s, Varian retook the Chicago Boys approach and added a new externality, stating that the consumer would not always have perfect information on how their own data would be used.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Economic aspects of personal privacy |title=Privacy and Self-regulation in the Information Age |first=H. R. |last=Varian |year=1997 }}</ref> [[Kenneth C. Laudon]] developed a model in which individuals own their data and have the ability to sell it as a product. He believed that such a system should not be regulated, to create a free market.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://archive.nyu.edu/bitstream/2451/14166/1/IS-97-04.pdf |title=Extensions to the theory of markets and privacy: Mechanics of pricing information |first=K. |last=Laudon |year=1997 }}</ref>
#In the 2000s, researchers worked on [[price discrimination]] (Taylor, 2004<ref>{{cite journal |title=Consumer privacy and the market for customer information |journal = The RAND Journal of Economics|volume = 35|issue = 4|pages = 631–650|first=C.

D. |last=Cornière |year=2011 |doi= 10.1257/mic.20130138 |url= https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/attachments?retrieve=mnaXJjc6R0mjP000FMjrrasXUbVQhy8q }}</ref>) and marketing strategies (Anderson and de Palma, 2012<ref>{{cite journal |title=Competition for attention in the information (overload) age |journal=The RAND Journal of Economics |volume=43 |pages=1–25 |first1=S. |last1=Anderson |first2=A. |last2=de Palma |year=2012 |doi=10.1111/j.1756-2171.2011.00155.x |s2cid=11606956 }}</ref>). The theories became complex, and showed that the impact of privacy on the economy highly depended on the context.{{clarify|date=July 2019}}
